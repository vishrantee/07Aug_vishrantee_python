hello
Plastic bags have become a necessity in our lives and provide us ease and convenience.
Plastic bags are non-biodegradable and take hundred of years to decompose in the soil.
These bags have become hazardous to all life forms on the planet.
The world consumes almost 1 Trillion plastic bags every year.
Plastic bags have led to significant land pollution and have caused unnatural deaths of aquatic species.
Many wild animals eat plastics, mistaking them as food, and die immediately.
Plastic bags have been banned in many countries, including India.
Remember always to pick up plastic litter in your surroundings.
They pollute and make the soil infertile and affect vegetative growth.
We should cultivate eco-friendly habits and say no to plastics.
